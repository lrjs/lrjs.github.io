LONG RANGE JUMP SHOT

Intro

At the tender age of 33 I decided to completely change up my jump shot mechanics in order to shoot the 3 pointer. I decided to reinvent the jump shot completely from the bottom up. This was partially inspired by Steph Curry. In order to accomplish this I bought a video camera and began to video tape my own shooting form. I also started doing extensive research of shot mechanics on Youtube. Everyone's body is slightly different and thus everyone's form will be unique. Kind of like a signature. However there are general concepts that the vast majority of amateur players get wrong. And even at the NBA level many players have flaws in their shooting form.
