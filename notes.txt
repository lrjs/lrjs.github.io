LONG RANGE JUMP SHOT

Notes

Record Self - I recommend recording yourself. There are so many aspects to proper mechanics
its much easier to look at yourself on video and attempt to identify where you might be inefficient.
Also what a player feels like he is doing might not actually be what he is doing. Video will
tell a better truth.

Concentration - when attempting to change mechanics, concentration is a must. The moment a
player loses concentration he will revert back to his old unoptimal mechanics.

Missing - get ready to miss a lot. Its really hard.

Unnatural - the most efficient way (that I know of) of shooting a basketball is a bit unnatural.
We shoot from a turned position but often start our jump from a squared up position which require
us to turn in the air and go from having the ball in front of us to releasing almost from the
side. If we were to shoot while squred up to the basket the hand naturally faces the basket.
When shooting from the side, we have to twist our forearm for the hand to face the basket.
From this position its often more comfortable to shoot off the index finger as that requires
a lesser twist of the forearm. However I believe the most optimal form is to twist the forearm
further and release with middle finger as the dominant finger.

Knee Bend - as we go into a jump shot, we will likely be on our toes or have a lot of weight
resting on the toes, as oppose to resting on the heel. From this position a deep knee bend
puts a lot of pressure on some of the ligaments in the knee, particular the patella tendon.
This doesn't affect the accuracy of the shot but is something to keep in mind.
