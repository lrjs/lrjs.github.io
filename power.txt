LONG RANGE JUMP SHOT

Power

For most amateur basketball players that play in the play ground jump shots within 15 feet of the basket are quite effortless. Players rise up and effortlessly release the ball and guide it torwards the basket. Somewhere between 15 feet and 20 feet is where most players start losing accuracy in an attempt to add more power to their shot. One can not simply push and flick the ball harder torwards the basket, or jump harder, without serious loss in accuracy.

When shooting from long range, 20+ feet, I find there are two different ways to shoot representing two different efficiency local maxima. The first is how the vast majority of amateurs shoot the long ball. Players set the ball as they dip their body in preparation for the jump and release the ball as they jump. This is actually highly efficient. Both jumping and releasing the ball are motions that lengthens the body, in particular they both lengthen the core of the body, it makes complete sense to execute them at the same time. Also by releasing as we jump power from the jump is very efficiently transfered into propulsion of the ball. Vast majorit of amateurs while learning to play basketball naturally find this shooting technique. Its biggest drawback is that the release point, and thus the first part of the trajectory torwards the basket is low, making it easier for defenders to block.

Most pros do not shoot long range jump shots like amateurs. They shoot elevate and release in mid air. While pros generally possess more upper body strength, its not this upper body strength that enables them to have an ariel release from long range. The ariel release is still a full body motion. There are various techniques to draw power from the body leading to an effortless release while shooting from long range.

The basketball is not that heavy, and a small amount of extra power can go a long way.

Sources of power from bottom up from the perspective of a right handed shooter:

The Hop - take a small hop into the jumpshot. The hop leads to a quicker jump as you are fighting less inertia compared to jumping from a more still position. The hop gives a small buildup into your jump. This hop will make a player's jump more effortless which indirectly leads to a more comfortable release from further out.

Setting the Ball - set the ball from a low position, and also set the ball as you push off the ground. As you swing the ball to the set point you capture a lot of upward momentum in the ball as well as your arms. If you set the ball as you jump you should be ready to release after you are set withoiut much delay. If you set the ball from a low position with some momentum, the ensuing release will capture some of that momentum adding power to your release.

Shoot Narrow - no matter how wide or narrow your feet are, as you become ariel and are about to release bring your legs and feet together as you release the ball. This motion elevates the center of gravity of your entire body and thus ads upward force to the release. To use an exaggerated example imagine a person jumping with a very wide stance, almost a split, and while ariel he brings his feet together is is almost straight up, he has significantly moved his center of gravity upwards, and some of that upward movement is transfered into upward force for the release.

(Above are more minor sources of power, below are two of what I consider the biggest sources of power)

Minimal Knee Bend - jumping is a motion that lengthens the body. To separate it from the release we don't want to jump with so much force such that the core of our bodies also lengthens. We want to keep the natural amount of compression in that region, so it can lengthen during the release. The easiest way to do this is to jump with minimal knee bend and mainly employee the calves and feet. This will not give you the most elevation but will lead to a much more powerful release. If you jump with a deep knee bend and make heavy use of your quads, it easy to go overboard and stretch out the core. But with conscious training one can jump with a deep knee bend and still maintain compression around the core (mid section around abs and lower back). If the core is not stretched out during the jump, it will naturally stretch (especially the right side) during the release. While one's center of gravity is not affected by this lengthening, it gives the upper body more upward momentum at the expense of the lower body. Its like the upper body is pushing against the lower body for additional elevation. This affect seems small, but it makes quite a difference.

Also once a player has separated the jump from the release he has the ability to choose when to release the ball once its set and he is airborn. The earlier the release the more upward momentum from the jump is captured at expense of height of release point. A player can use his discretion based on defense.

The Turn - often a player will naturally have his body squared up to the basket. However the release is a one handed motion and is best executed with the body turned to the left side. This is discussed in more detail in the document on mechanics. Releasing from a turned position is simply more comfortable as other muscles are not activated to hold a less natural position. But if a player is still turning the body (initiated at the hip) as he releases the ball, the turn can also add a lot of power to the release, even a slight turn, for example a 30 degree turn (from 45 degree to 75 degree angle between body and backboard). The turn propels the entire right arm torwards the basket. Also if a player goes straight up with the ball and arms in front of him, his upper torso should already be in a slight fade. From this position turning to the left will also naturally elevate the right hip relative to the left. This also adds slightly upward momentum to the entire right arm.

Notice that even though the release is airborn, the sources of power still come from the lower body and mid section. I used to believe that an airborn release is mainly an upperbody motion and that we add power by pushing and flicking the ball with more force. Now I believe release should always remain effortless for accuracy. Adding power in the arms and hands for a more powerful release will result in huge losses in accuracy.
